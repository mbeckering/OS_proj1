# OS_proj1
Project one for OS class @ UMSL

2/6/18: Basically revamped entire program because:
First iteration was mistakenly based on "Example 3.2" rather than "Program 3.2"
Incorporated getopt to the best of my ability (first time using it).
I believe I have provided sufficient input validation and detailed error messages related to input.
