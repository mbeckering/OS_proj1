2/6/18: Basically revamped entire program because:
First iteration was mistakenly based on "Example 3.2" rather than "Program 3.2"
Incorporated getopt to the best of my ability (first time using it).
I believe I have provided sufficient input validation and detailed error messages related to input.

2/7/18: Revamped again, correctly moving fork functionality to proc_fan after feedback from instructor. Got fgets correctly reading info from testing.data, calling testsim, and testsim correctly parsing command line args. Neither proc_fan or testsim have functionality yet except to transfer args coreectly.

2/8/18: Project is working. Still need to implement Makefile (never done a proper one). Still need to implement perror.
